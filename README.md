## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages)
- [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.io/)


### What I learned

In this challenge the main thing I learned is how to validate a date to make sure it meets your requirements. I also learned about the react-spring package which is a great tool for animating components.


### Continued development

The validation of the date is not perfect, I would like to improve it in the future. I would also like to improve the animation of the age numbers.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This site is the first place I look for answers about a problem I'm
  facing. 
- [Create a Number Animation with React Spring](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/create-a-number-animation-with-react-spring-670975daa28d) - This article was very simple to follow and helped me understand how to use react-spring.
